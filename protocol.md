# Agar.io Protocol v11

This file contains information about the client-server connection protocol 11.

## Data Types
Agar.io uses standard JavaScript DataView data types.

| Data Type | Description 
|-----------|-----------
| uint8     | Unsigned 1 byte integer (byte)
| uint16    | Unsigned 2 byte integer (short)
| uint32    | Unsigned 4 byte integer (int)
| float32   | Signed 4 byte floating point value
| float64   | Signed 8 byte floating point value
| string    | UTF-8
| boolean   | uint32 where 0 = false, 1 = true

Each packet starts with a uint8 containing the packet ID.

## Clientbound Packets
### Packet 16: Update Nodes (Decompressed part of the packet 255)
Sent to the client by the server to update information about one or more nodes. Nodes to be destroyed are placed at the beginning of the node data list.

#### Eat record

| Position | Data Type     | Description
|----------|---------------|-----------------
| 0        | uint8         | Packet ID
| 1        | uint16        | Number of nodes to be destroyed
| 2...?    | Destruct Data | Nodes' ID marked for destruction
| ?...?    | Node Data     | Data for all nodes
| ?        | uint32        | Always 0; terminates the node data listing
| ?        | uint16        | Always 0; discarded by the client
| ?        | uint16        | Number of nodes marked for destroying
| ?...?    | Destruct Data | Node ID of each destroyed node (uint32)

#### Node Data
Each visible node is described by the following data. This data repeats n times at the end of the Update Nodes packet, where n is the number specified by position 1 in the packet (number of nodes). Nodes that are stationary (like food) are only sent **once** to the client. In additon, the name field of each node is sent **once**.
